11 March 2015. AMAZING `Python` is AMAZING. A project to learn this wonderful language. Documenting 2015 via a second-a-day video, except I'm automating the actual selection of each second (for, one hopes, delightful results). Computer art?!


### To Do
1. Set up `git`, install `moviepy`.
2. Test run to see if it works.
3. Check if any day is missing (`os` file meta-data?).
4. Loop through, check that every day has a video.
5. If day is missing, write `error` message to file _and_ use stand-in black box with "Forgot today!" text.
6. If day is present, take 1-second random snip (use video meta-data to make it a `def` (function) of the video time-length).
7. Add text for each day: JANUARY 1. 
8. Stitch all clips together. Ta-da!
9. Make several versions?
10. Final editing polish with music, etc.
11. Can I use `HEX`/`RGB` for font color?
